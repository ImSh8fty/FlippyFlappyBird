# FlippyFlappyBird

Just like the 2014 game you hated... but only a bit harder so you cna hate it more :)

Flippy Flappy Bird essentailly has the same mechnaics as the original game, however, at random times the screen withh go upside down with adjusted physics!

Like my other project that alters the famous Pong game, I really enjoy taking classics and making them harder to challenge the average player, which is the reason for Flippy Flappy Bird. 

I also wanted to learn 2D phsyics in upside down scenarios!

Have Fun!
